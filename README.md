# CS-196-Final-Project
Pygame program for a game concept of a collection of minigames played as a medley for CS 196 at UIUC.

This Pygame project was my final submission for the CS 196 group final project at UIUC. This assignment was conducted over the course of about half of a semester, where I was grouped with seven other people. The minigames involve a boss rush, avoiding falling objects, red-light-green-light, pong, a space shooter, and card drawing.

Disclaimer: The final allowable submission date has long passed, so the ability to use this code to submit the assignment for a grade in the semester of Fall 2020 has similarly passed. I do not condone usage of this project for the purposes of cheating if this exact type of project assignment is to be re-used in future iterations of CS 196 at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
